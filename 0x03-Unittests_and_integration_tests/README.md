Here’s an overview of unit and integration testing, plus some commonly used testing patterns:

### Unit Tests
- **Definition**: Unit tests focus on testing individual "units" of code, typically functions or methods, in isolation.
- **Purpose**: They ensure that each part of the codebase functions correctly on its own. If there’s a bug in a function, a unit test should catch it without being affected by other parts of the system.
- **Example**: Testing a function that calculates the sum of two numbers. It should return the correct output regardless of any other functionality in the application.

### Integration Tests
- **Definition**: Integration tests evaluate how different units work together. They often test how different modules or services interact and whether they function correctly when combined.
- **Purpose**: They ensure that units operate together correctly, catching issues that might not appear in isolated unit tests.
- **Example**: Testing an API endpoint that relies on both a controller and a database. An integration test would check if the endpoint fetches and returns the correct data from the database.

### Common Testing Patterns
1. **Mocking**
   - **Purpose**: Mocking is used to simulate the behavior of complex objects or dependencies (like databases, external APIs, or other modules) that aren’t the primary focus of the test.
   - **Usage**: Mocking is often used in unit tests to isolate the function being tested by replacing dependencies with controlled, predictable versions.
   - **Example**: Using a mock database to test a function that retrieves data, so you don’t need an actual database connection.

2. **Parametrization**
   - **Purpose**: Parametrization allows running the same test with multiple sets of input data, increasing test coverage without duplicating code.
   - **Usage**: It’s useful for testing edge cases and verifying that functions handle various inputs correctly.
   - **Example**: Testing a function that converts temperatures from Celsius to Fahrenheit with a variety of Celsius values, expecting different Fahrenheit results each time.

3. **Fixtures**
   - **Purpose**: Fixtures are used to set up a known state before tests run and to clean up afterward. They can create test data or configurations that will be used across multiple tests.
   - **Usage**: Fixtures are particularly useful in integration tests where the setup is complex, such as preparing a database with data.
   - **Example**: A database fixture that populates tables with test data before running tests, ensuring each test has consistent data to work with.

These patterns help make tests faster, more reliable, and easier to maintain, especially when dealing with complex applications.
